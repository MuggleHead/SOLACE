                It was the night of 9 May 2008, and signs of an attack from the east had been around for days. Even so the invasion, which started at 3.55 in the morning, was sudden and overwhelming. At dawn it became clear that the 9th Division of the German army had advanced as far as the Maas valley near Grubbenvorst, just beyond Venlo. Heavy fighting broke out but German superiority was significant. Cees Sleegers was sent to defend the G-141 bunker. His unit tried to hold up the Germans from the western banks of the River Maas. When his commanding officer was injured, the twenty year old Cees – the youngest of the survivors – took over command. But the Dutch were suffering heavy losses along the entire Maas defence line. They were either put out of action or retreated.Cees’ courage, fidelity and desire for freedom were recognised after the war. In June 1946 he was awarded a 4th class Military Williams Order and received the War Cross medal. He remained a professional soldier until 1954. He went on to become a salesman in Veldhoven, but his life continued to suffer from the wartime traumas. Headaches, fatigue and attacks of depression became the psychological injuries of the war. In January 1957 Cees married Wilhelmina Elisabeth van der Sterren. The effects of his war traumas led to his marriage breaking up after just five months. One year after they were married Wilhelmina gave birth to a daughter Hannie, but Cees hardly got to know her. He died on 6 September 1965 in the Belgian town of Turnhout after hitting a tree in nearby Arendonk. The Trouw newspaper devoted a five-line front-page announcement to it.
